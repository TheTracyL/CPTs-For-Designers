==================

The files for my Custom Post Types for designers presentation.
http://www.slideshare.net/thetracyl/custom-post-types-for-designers

It guides you through creating Custom Post Types for WordPress.

It uses Eddie Machado's Bones CPT template with my own stuff thrown in.
The front-end templates use Automatic's Underscores as a base. 

Happy Custom Post Type making!
