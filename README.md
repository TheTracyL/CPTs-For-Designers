CPTs-For-Designers
==================

The files for my Custom Post Types for designers presentation.
http://www.slideshare.net/thetracyl/custom-post-types-for-designers

It guides you through creating Custom Post Types for WordPress.

It uses Eddie Machado's Bones CPT template with my own stuff thrown in. http://themble.com/bones/
The front-end templates use Automatic's Underscores as a base. http://underscores.me/

My theme uses Twitter Bootstrap, so if you want to make the templates look like the example you will have to incorporate Twitter Bootstap into your theme. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap

Happy Custom Post Type making!
